### Getting Started
Create React App is an officially supported way to create single-page React applications. It offers a modern build setup with no configuration.

> If you've previously installed create-react-app globally via npm install -g create-react-app, we recommend you uninstall the package using npm uninstall -g create-react-app or yarn global remove create-react-app to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.
